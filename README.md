# WARPlab_IF

Matlab code that uses the WARPlab framework to build a 2x2 MIMO wireless network.
The purpose of this project is to build a framework that enables the use of interger-forcing linear receivers in an experimental practical setup using WARP boards. 

The shared code implements the following receivers: 
- integer-forcing (IF) linear receiver, see the file: 
- exact-integer-forcing (eIF) linear receiver, see the file: 
- maximum-likelihood(ML) receiver, see the file: 
- zero-forcing(ZF) linear receiver, see the file: 
- minimum-mean square error(MMSE) linear receivers.
